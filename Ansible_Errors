### Error: fatal: [172.31.4.225]: FAILED! => {"ansible_facts": {"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"}, "changed": false, "msg": "The following packages have pending transactions: httpd-x86_64", "rc": 125, "results": []}


The error message indicates that the installation of `httpd` is failing because there are **pending transactions** for the package `httpd-x86_64`. This usually happens when a previous package installation was interrupted or not completed properly.

### üîπ **Fix the issue:**
#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Check and clear pending transactions**
Run this command on the target machine (`172.31.4.225`) to see if there are any pending transactions:
```bash
sudo yum-complete-transaction --cleanup-only
```
If the command isn't found, install `yum-utils`:
```bash
sudo yum install -y yum-utils
```
Then retry:
```bash
sudo yum-complete-transaction --cleanup-only
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Manually clean up the cache**
Run these commands:
```bash
sudo yum clean all
sudo yum makecache
```

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Retry the Ansible playbook**
After performing the above steps, rerun your playbook:
```bash
ansible-playbook main4.yml
```

### ‚úÖ **Additional Fix (If Issue Persists)**
If the error still appears, try manually finishing the pending transactions using:
```bash
sudo yum check
sudo yum update -y
```
Then retry your Ansible playbook.
